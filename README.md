# Functions and algorithms developed in the first course in a Bioinformatics specialization series.

Uses computational algorithmic approaches to find the origins of replication and regulatory motifs. Utilizes randomized algorithms to find motifs.
* Develops algorithms that can be used to find bactorial origins of replication
* Cummulates into developing the Gibb Sampler algorithm to find significant biologically relevent regulatory motifs.
